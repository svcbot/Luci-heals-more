# Luci heals more - a mod for RimWorld

v 2.0.0

This mod changes how luciferium heals. In vanilla it takes 1 to 2 seasons to heal a permanent injury, whether it is a 1/10 permanent brain injury or 29/30 permanent leg gunshot injury. This mod makes the heal event happen a lot more often, but the healing power is reduced, so that only ~ 4 % body part hp are healed during a day. So the 1/10 brain injury can take the same 1 to 2 seasons to be fully removed, but the pawn will start beeing useful much sooner. This is also more helpful, if the pawn has many small injuries. Things like chemical damage and cirrhosis can now also be healed with luciferium. Beeing old is not a problem anymore: luciferium will also reduce the biological age (toggleable in the options). 

Features list:
* Luciferium healing occurs every 4 hours, instead of 15 to 30 days as in vanilla.
* Chronic diseases will be gradually healed alongside permanent injuries. Also additionally heals chemical damage, cirrhosis and trauma Savant (toggleable in the options).
* Reduction of the biological age if older and acceleration towards the optimal age (25 years in humans, begin of the third life stage in animals) if younger (toggleable in the options).
* Does not require a new game. 
* Work in progress: regrows missing body parts (toggleable in the options)
